<p>After working in internal medicine, Dale recognized that many patients did not fit into the traditional treatment model or were offered pharmaceuticals when lifestyle interventions or a more natural approach would have been the more appropriate route. She believes patients deserve to be equal partners in their quest to reach optimal health, and that a person’s day-to-day life choices and habits are crucial to success. From her many years of health coaching she has found there is no substitute for having in-depth conversations with patients about their health concerns, challenges and goals. Often, small adjustments in diet and lifestyle result in fewer medications and a higher quality of life.
